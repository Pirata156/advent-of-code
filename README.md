# Advent of Code — Me Treasure Trove o’ Puzzles 🧩🏴‍☠️

Ahoy, matey!  
Welcome aboard me Advent of Code repository, where I stash all the clever little solutions I forge while sailin’ through the yearly AoC seas.  
I be startin’ in **2025**, but with luck and rum I’ll be chartin’ many more years to come — even in different tongues o’ code.

## 📚 Repository Structure

```
<year>
    <day>
        puzzle01.py (or .js/.rs/…)
        puzzle02.py (or .js/.rs/…)
        example.txt
```

- **year**: the calendar year of the AoC edition (e.g. `2025`)
- **day**: the day of that year's challenges
- **puzzleXX.py**: the code for a given day’s puzzles

Pick a year, pick a day, and plunder the solutions as ye see fit.

## 🚀 How to Run

Assuming you are in the folder of a given year and language:

```bash
python3 puzzle01.py <filename>  # runs the solution for puzzle 1 of that day.
python3 puzzle02.py <filename>  # runs the solution for puzzle 2 of that day.
```

If I use other languages, then adjust accordingly:


```bash
./puzzle0101.sh <filename>  # runs the solution for day 1 first puzzle
./puzzle0102.sh <filename>  # runs the solution for day 1 second puzzle
```

Adjust as the winds require.

## 📝 Notes & Future Plans

* I begin with 2025, but I’ll be explorin’ older waters soon enough.
* Should I craft solutions in different languages, I’ll keep ’em all — good for comparin’ tools in me pirate arsenal.
* I may scribble notes, thoughts, triumphs, and “what in the seven seas was I thinkin’?” moments.

## 🎯 Why I Brave These Waters

* I enjoy puzzles, savvy? Simple as that.
* And someone introduced me to this Advent o’ Code. Croc be them, for now I be hooked!

## ✅ Contributing

I don’t expect many external contributions, but if you want to:

* Feel free to open an issue or pull-request — especially if you spot a bug, or have a more elegant solution in another language.
* Respect the folder structure.
* If adding inputs — follow good practices (e.g. don’t expose your private info or input).
